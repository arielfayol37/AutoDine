    2) Reply to the customer with the appriopriate response/interaction if he hasn't ordered yet, and "ORDER" should be an empty dictionary

    Example 1:
    Input: "I'd like a burger with extra cheese and a side of fries, and also a chicken biryani with 2 extra bowls rice and extra chicken."
    Output:
